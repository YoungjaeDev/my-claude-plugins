# Fixture-driven checks for the two cr-fix paths that only execute when the
# primary path has already failed, and which therefore had nothing exercising
# them (issue #105): the CodeRabbit CLI JSONL parser, and the commit-state
# reader that decides whether a review has finished.
#
# No network, no `gh`, no live PR. cr-commit-state.sh reads its two HTTP
# responses from CR_STATE_STATUSES_FILE / CR_STATE_CHECKRUNS_FILE when set.
