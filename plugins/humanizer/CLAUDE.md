| `humanize` | Remove AI writing patterns to make text sound natural |

## Purpose

Identify and remove common AI writing patterns (inflated significance, promotional language, AI vocabulary, em dash overuse, etc.) to make text sound more natural and human-written.

## Triggers

- "humanize this"
- "make it sound human"
- "remove AI patterns"
- "make this less robotic"
- Text review/editing requests

## Based On

Wikipedia's "Signs of AI writing" guide maintained by WikiProject AI Cleanup. Detects 24 patterns across:
- Content patterns (significance inflation, promotional language)
- Language patterns (AI vocabulary, copula avoidance)
- Style patterns (em dash overuse, boldface overuse)
- Communication patterns (chatbot artifacts, sycophantic tone)

## Output

Rewritten text with AI patterns removed, optionally with a summary of changes made.
